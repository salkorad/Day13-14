        <p>Skiing is the action of travelling over snow on skis, especially as a sport or 
            recreation. Competitive skiing falls into two categories: 
            Nordic (cross-country racing, jumping, and biathlon) and 
            Alpine (downhill or straight racing, and slalom racing round a series of markers).</p>
